# CryptoImplementations

## Introduction
Welcome to `CryptoImplementations`, a repository focused on demonstrating key computer security techniques using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) encryption, and digital signatures in Python.

## Features
- **AES Implementation**: Demonstrates the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard for secure data encryption.
- **RSA Encryption**: Showcases the implementation of RSA, a widely-used public-key cryptosystem.
- **Digital Signatures**: Covers the implementation of digital signatures to verify message or file authenticity and integrity.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the project.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/huigeonkim/CryptoImplementations.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
`cd CryptoImplementations`

3. Install any required dependencies (if specified).

## Usage
The project includes several scripts that demonstrate different security techniques:
1. `save.py`: Initialize the components for encryption.
2. `server2.py`: Acts as a server in the security protocol.
3. `client2.py`: Functions as a client, interacting with the server in `server2.py`.
